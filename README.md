# Development workflow

In general, new features & bugfixes should be added to the [`develop`](https://github.com/mattdxx/mindfulnesssummit/tree/develop) branch. If you're working on anything more than a very simple fix or addition, please create a new branch (from `develop`) to house your work. Once it's complete to your satisfaction, merge your branch into `develop` and open a pull request or issue on GitHub for it to be tested and merged into `staging` and `master`.

This workflow should continue to evolve and improve; please feel free to open an issue here or start a discussion in #tech on Slack to discuss improvements.
